        Quality chocolate packaging builds brand authority, and brand authority
        transforms into sales. The goal is to create a modern trendy
        approachable design to speak and communicate with consumers. The muted
        color schemes are chosen in order do not to overwhelm and irritate the
        consumer but to grab the attention in a casual relaxing way. It also
        gives an association with the chocolate flavor filling. There is as much
        information on the front as the consumer needs; no unnecessary elements
        and details that would distract from simply liking it. All the elements
        are arranged in a non-conflicting complimentary way. Inconspicuous
        triangle custom pattern creates a modern look and makes the design
        appealing.
